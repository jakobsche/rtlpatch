# rtlpatch
Lazarus Package with perhaps useful extensions being missed in the RTL

When I initiated this package some years ago, I missed the routines in the RTL of Free Pascal. May be, few things are no longe necessary now. Some might be used alternatively to RTL content.

License: Use this package under the same conditions as the Lazarus Component Library. Details can be found in the file COPYING.txt.
